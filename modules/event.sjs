  @module    event
  @summary   Event emitter and utilities for dealing with events.
  @home      sjs:event
  @require   sjs:xbrowser/dom
  @desc
    This module deals with two sources of events:

    ### Explicitly triggered  events:
    
    To create an event that your code will trigger, use [::Emitter].
    Emitters have the `emit(value)` method, which is used to trigger the event.

    ### Wrapped external events:

    To respond to events on a DOM object or a nodejs EventEmitter, you should
    use [::HostEmitter]. This creates a [::BaseEmitter] for the underlying
    events, which means they can be used just like [::Emitter] objects.

    Utility functions `wait` and `when` are provided for responding to
    external events in a more concise way than building a [::HostEmitter].

/**
  @function  BaseEmitter.queue
  @summary Constructs a queue of this emitter's events.
  @return  {::Queue}
  @param   {Settings} [opts]
  @setting {Number} [capacity] Maximum number of events to buffer in the queue (default 100). Events will be dropped if the queue grows beyond this size. For each dropped event an exception will be reported in the console.
  @setting {Boolean} [bound] Whether to `stop` the underlying emitter when this Queue is stopped (default `true`).
  @desc
    The returned [::Queue] object proceeds to listen for
    events immediately in the background, and continues to do so until
    [::Queue::stop] is called.

    Alternatively, because [::Queue] implements a
    [::Queue::__finally__] method, it can be used in a
    `using` block:

        using (var q = emitter.queue()) {
          while (true) {
            var data = q.get();
            ...
          }
        }

    Here the `using` construct will automatically call
    [::Queue::stop] when the `using` code
    block is exited.

    By default, stopping an event queue will also call `stop` on the original
    event emitter. To avoid this behvaiour, set `opts.bound` to false.
*/

  var rv = Object.create(QueueProto);
  rv.init(this, opts);
  return rv;
};

/**
   @function BaseEmitter.stream
   @return {sequence::Stream}
   @summary  Create a continuous stream from this emitter's events.
   @desc
      Up to one event is buffered - that is, if you call:

          emitter.stream() .. seq.each {|event|
            doSomething(event);
          }

      If multiple events are emitted while `doSomething` is executing, all but the
      most recent will be skipped.

      It will also skip any events that occur *before* you start iterating over its result.

      **Note**: the generated stream will never complete - it will continue waiting
      for futher events until retracted.

      ### Example:

          // Assume dataStore.recordAdded is a [::BaseEmitter] object
          // which emits the record each time a new record is added.
          
          var newRecord = dataStore.recordAdded;
          
          var people = newRecord.stream() .. filter(p -> p.isPerson());
          var firstTenPeople = people .. take(10);

      The returned stream will have a `__finally_` method that simply calls
      this emitter's finally method, if this emitter has a __finally__ method.

    By default, events will be dealt with synchronously - any events that
    occur during a call to `block(e)` will be missed if `block` suspends.
    However, if you set `opts.queue` to `true`, events will be buffered
    in a [::Queue] until they can be processed.

    **Note:** Unlike [::when], this function will not automatically call
    `__finally__` on the underlying emitter upon completion. This only
    matters for [::HostEmitter] objects, since [::Emitter]s have no
    `__finally__` method.

  @setting   {Function} [handle] A handler function to call directly on the event.
  @setting   {Function} [transform] Function through which an
             event will be passed before filtering.
  @desc
    A "host" event emitter is a native [nodejs EventEmitter](http://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_class_events_eventemitter) object when running in nodejs,
    and a DOM element in the browser.

    Note that since creating a `HostEmitter` adds a listener to the
    underlying emitter, you *must* call `emitter.stop()` to prevent resource leaks.

    Instead of calling `stop()` explicitly, you can pass this object to a
    `using` block, e.g.:

        using (var click = cutil.HostEmitter(elem, 'click')) {
          click.wait();
          console.log("Thanks for clicking!");
        }

    ### Notes

    * In the browser, you typically want to pass [sjs:xbrowser/dom::preventDefault] or
      [sjs:xbrowser/dom::stopPropagation] if you are handling this event yourself.

    * If the underlying event emitter passes a single argument to listener functions,
      this argument will be returned from `wait()`. But if multiple arguments are passed
      to the listener, an array of all arguments will be returned from `wait()`.

    * In the browser, [xbrowser/dom::addListener] is used to bind the event
      listener - so you can prefix events with "!" to have the event fire
      during the "capture" phase.

    * If using a [::BaseEmitter::queue] or [::BaseEmitter::stream], events may be held for some time before
      they get handled. So calls that influence the internal handling of the event
      (such as [xbrowser/dom::stopEvent]), should be called from the `handle` function,
      rather than after the event is retrieved.

    * IE multiplexes all events onto a global event object. To ensure events
      are the same events that were put in, the implementation
      clones events on IE before emitting them.
      This means that calls such as [xbrowser/dom::stopEvent] will **never** work on IE if
      performed on the return value of [::BaseEmitter::wait]. To have any effect, these
      calls must be performed from the `handle` function.

    * You should only need to use the `transform` setting in rare cases. This
      setting is primarily for use when you need to attach additional custom
      information to an event before it can be filtered. It is not the place
      for calling things like `e.preventDefault`, as it runs *before* any event filter.
